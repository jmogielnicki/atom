Note:
--------

To allow full project indexing you have to create `lupaProject.json` in root directory of your project. Example file:
```
{
    "filePattern": "src/**/*.js"
}
```


This package shows structure of each JavaScript file, with clickable list of functions, imports etc. It allows you to navigate also between different files in project, shows what modules in project import particular file.

##### It allows you to filter entries by name or type, e.g.:

![atom screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hex13/atom-lupa/master/screenshot-3.png)

##### You can also perform deep searching, e.g. you can find all functions that have their first parameter named `err`.

examples of semantic search (DSL can change in future versions).

type:objectLiteral

(space has meaning so this isn't gonna work:

type :   objectLiteral #doesn't gonna work

Example below finds functions which have foo in name:

type:function foo

type:class

type:todo

params.length:2

params[0].name:err

jsx:true

loc.start.column:7

loc.start.line:3

Example below finds external imports (i.e. these from node_modules):

source:node_modules

##### It has support for:

* ES5 (just plain old JavaScript)
* ES6 (e.g. it detects imports/exports, ES6 classes and arrow functions)
* JSX (so it can be helpful during development with React)
* CommonJS (it detects `require(...)`s )
* AngularJS (eg. it detects AngularJS directives)
* Python (basic support)
* CoffeeScript (basic support)
